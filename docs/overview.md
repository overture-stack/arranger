# Overview

Arranger is a versatile, data-agnostic GraphQL search API that leverages Elasticsearch, designed to simplify the process of creating powerful search interfaces for complex datasets. It's accompanied by its own React component library to generate interactive and highly configurable search UIs.

    :::info Arranger uses Elasticsearch v7

    Our search platform is built on and compatible with version 7.x of Elasticsearch. All queries to ES must follow that version's syntax and conventions.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Search UI:** Provides a suite of customizable search interface components based on Elasticsearch index mappings, easily tailored to fit specific data structures and user needs without extensive manual coding.
- **GraphQL API:** Arranger Server generates a GraphQL API from Elasticsearch mappings, offering:
    - Efficient data retrieval
    - Adaptable structure
    - SQON integration for human-readable and machine-processable search queries
- **Data Agnostic:** Works with any properly structured Elasticsearch index.
- **Integration-Ready:** Designed to work with any React-based front-end UIs.

## System Architecture

Arranger integrates with your underlying Elasticsearch cluster to automatically generate a powerful GraphQL search API based on your configured index mapping. It consists of two main modules:

- **Arranger Server:** The back-end search API service that:

    - Generates a GraphQL API from Elasticsearch mappings
    - Acts as middleware between the UI and Elasticsearch
    - Simplifies querying and filtering using Serializable Query Object Notation ([SQON](https://www.overture.bio/documentation/arranger/reference/sqon/))
    - Provides an intermediary layer to avoid direct interaction with complex Elasticsearch queries

- **Arranger Components:** A library of React components for building interactive search UIs, communicating with Arranger Server to fetch and display data.

As part of the larger Overture.bio software suite, Arranger typically integrates with other services:

- **Elasticsearch:** The underlying search and analytics engine (created and maintained by [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch)) that Arranger interfaces with to provide powerful search capabilities.
- **Stage:** The React-based web portal scaffolding that provides the overall structure and layout, within which Arranger components are rendered to create a cohesive and interactive data exploration interface.

The Arranger Components image above highlights three key features:

- **Faceted Search (Red):** Allow users to filter data using multiple dimensions.
- **Data Tables (Blue):** Display search results in a customizable, interactive table format.
- **SQON Viewers (Yellow):** Visualize and manage complex search queries.
