Arranger for Application Developers
================================

Arranger comes in individual pieces that can be flexibly composed together to meet your application's needs. These include:
  - `@arranger/server <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/server>`_: the main server-side application
  - `@arranger/components <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/components>`_: UI components used for building end-user facing applications
  - `@arranger/admin <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/admin>`_: the server-side admin Graphql API
  - `@arranger/admin-ui <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/admin-ui>`_: the UI interface as described in the `Arranger for Administrators <admins.html>`_ guide.

Additionally, some packages that are used internally are also published. These include:
  - `@arranger/schema <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/schema>`_: contains the Graphql schema generated and served by `@arranger/server`.
  - `@arranger/mapping-utils <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/mapping-utils>`_: contains utility functions used for computing / interpreting elasticsearch mappings and Arranger metadata about the mappings.
  - `@arranger/middleware <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arranger/middleware>`_: responsible for translating SQON and aggregation parameters from the `@arranger/server` to elasticsearch queries and aggregations.
